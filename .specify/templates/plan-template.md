# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Spec-Kit Traceability**: plan links to the active `spec.md`, records
  generated artifacts, and avoids implementation work not represented in
  `tasks.md`.
- **Low Coupling, High Cohesion**: plan names module boundaries, dependency
  direction, and any file-size exceptions before code movement starts.
- **Stable Public Behavior**: plan identifies CLI/import/JSON/SQLite/protocol
  surfaces that must remain compatible, or declares an explicit spec change.
- **Local Safety And Data Integrity**: plan lists AIT-owned path boundaries,
  Git/SQLite mutation policy, and unsafe edge-case tests for touched surfaces.
- **Verification Before Completion**: plan defines targeted tests, full-suite
  expectations, `git diff --check`, and spec-specific acceptance checks.

Gate result: [PASS/FAIL with justification for every item above]

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

### Dependency Direction

[Document allowed import direction, repository/interface boundaries, and which
modules own policy, persistence, CLI rendering, and subprocess side effects.]

### Public Compatibility Surface

[List command names/flags, import shims, JSON keys, SQLite semantics, daemon
protocol envelopes, resource files, or docs that must remain stable.]

### Verification Plan

[List the exact targeted tests, full-suite commands, static checks, manual
acceptance checks, and evidence required before tasks may be marked complete.]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
